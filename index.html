        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Miguel Rodrigues de Carvalho" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Miguel Rodrigues de Carvalho and I am from S√£o Vicente, S√£o Paulo, Brazil (the first city of Brazil). I enjoy play video games, drawing, reading, code and practice martial arts.
        I start to learn english since I was 8 years old.
        I served as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (2018-2020). I have a beautiful bride. I have one old sister and one young brother.
        Today I work as a Stockroom Assistant, but I'm studying technology since 2020 because I want to become a game developer, but even through I like learning about code in general. And, for that reason I concluded a Hardware course to have more knowledge.
        Not only this, but I hope to do something really good for the sociaty, whatever the place of technology industry. I like to understand more about tech things.
        </p>
